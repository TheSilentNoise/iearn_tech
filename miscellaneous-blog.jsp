				<hr>
				<p>API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface,
					which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to
					talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an
					instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using
					an API.&#8230;</p>
